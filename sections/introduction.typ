  + Don't worry if you don't know what Nix is yet – in fact, it's probably better if you don't
  + Most Nix users don't even know what Nix is or how it works!
  + Explaining Nix to a total beginner is actually easier
  + The reason for this is that different people use Nix for different things
  + Every Nix user learned Nix in different ways
  + Most people hear about Nix because someone tried selling it to them – often just the parts that *they* care about
  + And in fact, here we are in this lecture, and I'm also here to sell you Nix!
  + I believe Nix solves problems everybody here has encountered, even if not all things Nix offers are relevant to you
  + Nix is not a single technology but rather an implementation of an idea with a solid theoretical foundation and an area of active research
  + This means that the things we'll talk about today are highly transferrable
  + Whether or not you end up using Nix, these ideas will shape the future of software engineering
